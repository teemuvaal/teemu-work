            I'm an adult educator who leaped to the dark side - startups.
            I build things for the web for myself, but also fiddle with the front-end of <a className="text-gray-500 underline" href="https://claned.com" target="_blank">CLANED</a>. Expert in anything 
            that comes to online learning. Learning Analytics is my jam but I'm into Data Analytics in general and especially if you can enhance it with AI. I like the stuff between humans and technology.
